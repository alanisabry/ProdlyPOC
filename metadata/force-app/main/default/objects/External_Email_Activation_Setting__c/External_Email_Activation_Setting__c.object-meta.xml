    <description>BODEV-1487: In order to prevent emails from being sent to external parties (customers/partners) unexpectedly from Sandbox orgs, external emails should be sent only when the corresponding custom setting field is active.
The settings should NEVER be active in production so that all Sandboxes will have False value in default. Production can be exempted from this check by checking the Org ID.</description>
